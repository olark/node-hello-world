# Silly sample node app

Make sure you have node 0.8.x somewhere with `node --version`.  Try
[nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) to install node... it's easy and
you can use multiple versions.

Try:

```
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

Now go to http://localhost:4000 and you should see a hello world.

## When stuff breaks

You need some dependencies for node-stringprep.  See the readme
[here](https://github.com/astro/node-stringprep) to see how to install
icu for your platform.
